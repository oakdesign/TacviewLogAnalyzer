## Features

- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Pilot performance with shots, hits, kills, and flight times
- **Weapon Analysis**: Detailed breakdown by weapon type and effectiveness
- **Air-to-Air Combat**: Specialized A-A kill tracking grouped by target aircraft type  
- **Interception Detection**: Identifies when A-G weapons are shot down before reaching targets
- **Web Interface**: Interactive browser-based analysis dashboard
- **Standalone Executable**: No Python installation required for end users
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for automated analysis
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Summary reports, detailed chains, and web UI

## End-User Guide (Standalone Executable)

### Download and Setup

1. **Download** the latest `TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/oakdesign/TacviewLogAnalyzer/releases) page
2. **No installation required** - the .exe is completely standalone
3. **Place the executable** in any folder of your choice

### Basic Usage
Tacview load you acmi in Tacview and go to File->Export Flight Log and select to export as .xml

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the folder containing the .exe and run:

```cmd
# Generate comprehensive summary report
TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe --summary your_tacview_log.xml

# Launch interactive web interface (opens in browser)
TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe --web your_tacview_log.xml

# View detailed engagement chains
TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe --chains-combined your_tacview_log.xml

# Show all available options
TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe --help
```

### Custom Web Interface Templates

**Advanced Feature**: You can customize the web interface appearance by providing your own HTML template:

1. **Create custom template**: Copy the original `index.html` from inside the executable or create your own
2. **Place alongside executable**: Save your custom template as `index.html` in the same folder as `TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe`
3. **Launch normally**: The executable will automatically use your custom template instead of the built-in one

```cmd
# Example directory structure for custom template:
MyAnalysisFolder/
├── TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe
├── index.html          <- Your custom template
└── mission_log.xml

# Run with custom template (automatically detected)
TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe --web mission_log.xml
```

**Template Requirements:**
- Must be valid HTML with Jinja2 template syntax
- Use the same template variables as the original (`vm`, `xml`, `error`, `hasData`)
- Include JavaScript for sorting functionality if desired
- Can completely customize styling, colors, fonts, and layout

**Example Template:**
Download the [example custom template](examples/custom_template_example.html) from this repository to see:
- Dark theme with terminal-style aesthetics
- Custom colors and styling
- Comprehensive comments explaining customization options
- All functionality preserved from the original template

### Understanding the Output

**Summary Report includes:**
- **Pilot Statistics**: Individual pilot performance with shots/hits/kills and flight time
- **Weapon Breakdown**: Shots fired per weapon type for each pilot
- **Flight Outcomes**: How each pilot's flight ended (Landed, Shot down, Ejected, etc.)
- **A-A Kills by Target**: Air-to-air kills grouped by target aircraft type (e.g., "MiG-29S Fulcrum-C 12 kills")

**Web Interface provides:**
- Interactive browsing of all engagement data
- Sortable tables and detailed event information
- Visual timeline of combat events
- Export capabilities for further analysis

### Example Usage

```cmd
# Analyze a BMS mission log
TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe --summary "2025-10-22_Mission.xml"

# Launch web interface for detailed analysis
TacviewLogAnalyzer.exe --web "2025-10-22_Mission.xml"
```

The web interface will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **No additional software required** - the executable is completely self-contained
- **Memory**: Sufficient RAM to load XML files (typically 100MB+ for large mission logs)
- **Disk Space**: Minimal (executable is ~15-20MB)

### Troubleshooting

**If the executable doesn't run:**
- Ensure you're using a 64-bit Windows system
- Try running from Command Prompt to see any error messages
- Check that your antivirus isn't blocking the executable

**If the web interface doesn't open:**
- Manually navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
- Ensure no other application is using port 8000
- Check Windows Firewall settings if needed

**For large XML files:**
- The tool can handle files up to several hundred MB
- Processing time scales with file size and number of events
- Consider using `--summary` mode for faster analysis of very large files

**For custom templates:**
- Ensure your `index.html` is in the same directory as the executable
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors if sorting doesn't work
- Use the [example template](examples/custom_template_example.html) as a starting point
- Template must use valid HTML and Jinja2 syntax

**Custom template issues:**
- If your custom `index.html` causes errors, remove it to revert to the built-in template
- Ensure your template uses proper Jinja2 syntax and includes required template variables
- Test template changes incrementally to identify syntax errors

## Developer Guide

## Key Features Explained

### Air-to-Air Kill Analysis
Groups A-A kills by target aircraft type using sophisticated weapon classification:
- Automatically detects A-A vs A-G weapons based on target type and weapon characteristics
- Provides cumulative counts (e.g., "MiG-29S Fulcrum-C 12 kills")
- Excludes ground targets and non-combat events

### Interception Detection
Identifies when air-to-ground weapons are intercepted before reaching their targets:
- Tracks AGM, GBU, JDAM, and other A-G weapons
- Detects when they are shot down by enemy missiles
- Classifies as "intercepted" rather than miss or hit

### Web Interface
Provides comprehensive analysis dashboard:
- Real-time event browsing and filtering
- Interactive engagement chains
- Sortable pilot and weapon statistics
- Export capabilities for detailed analysis
